i am  building an extension, that doesnt promote tutorial-hell.It works the following way.

1. Pause the currently playing youtube video
2. Obtain transcript of the video, with timestamps
3. Provide transcript to an ai model using api,
4. Generate questions based on the transcript from start to up until the duration the video was paused by the extension.
5. Display the questions at the extension side.

I currently have an express js server boilerplate set up.How to proceed next?






#After every change, reload page, and reload extension from brave://extensions/
